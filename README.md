# Sonic R Manual
This Manual is built for the 2004 PC release of Sonic R

## Settings and other gameplay information
There are currently only 2 settings, Balloonsanity and Traps.

Balloonsanity helps make an otherwise small unimpactful game actually have potential to hold some weight so I do definitely reccomend keeping that setting on.

Traps are off by default because although I made them I think they are lame, but maybe someone will think they are funny.
There is more information on what the traps are meant to do in the template yaml but just for ease of access..

Retire trap means you have to retire from the race you are currently in
Gravity trap means you cant jump for 10 seconds
Ice trap means you can't input anything for 5 seconds

Feel free to interpret them as you want, it's a manual after all, you can do whatever you want when the traps come up.

There are also junk items set up as rings, as of right now they don't do anything and I don't have the skill, or the access to a cheat table to be able
to make adding rings mid game feasible. They are just placeholders to have enough locations.

## Sonic R Setup
I cannot provide you with the pc port of sonic r, but if you happen it please use this updater made by cheatfreak47
https://github.com/cheatfreak47/SRUpdater/releases/tag/1.0.10

This will turn whatever Sonic R PC release you have into the 2004 version, it will also download the SonicR ModManager with a few preinstalled mods and codes.

The 2 codes that really matter are "Practice Mode" (Tokens/Emeralds Always Spawn) and if Balloonsanity is on "Hard Balloon Mode" (Need All 17 Balloons). "Easy Balloon Mode" (All 17 Balloons Always Spawn) is also optional

## Usage
You will need Archipelago which you can find here https://archipelago.gg/
You will also need the most recent version of the manual apworld, you can find that here https://github.com/ManualForArchipelago/Manual Or in the Archi Manual Discord https://discord.gg/T5bcsVHByx
Put the manual apworld as well as the apworld downloaded here into Archipelago/lib/worlds
Edit the template yaml provided and put it in the Archipelago/Players folder as with any other yamls you are playing with, or send it to the host along with the apworld.
Manuals can only be generated locally so run ArchipelagoGenereate.exe (Host only)
From there it will generate a randomizer in the Archipelago/output folder, you can either host locally via ArchipelagoServer.exe or upload it to archi to host via https://archipelago.gg/uploads

## Tracker
I also made a poptracker pack for the game, you can find it here: https://github.com/halloweeniez/Sonic-R-Tracker
