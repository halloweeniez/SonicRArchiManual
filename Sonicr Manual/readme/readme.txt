This Manual is built for the 2004 PC release of Sonic R

Whether or not you have the correct build or not, please use this updater made by cheatfreak47
https://github.com/cheatfreak47/SRUpdater/releases/tag/1.0.10

This will also download the SonicR ModManager with a few preinstalled mods and codes

Aside from the "codes" tab in the ModManager, all other settings are optional

Please see image in folder named "SonicROptions" for which codes to have on
Practice Mode is neccesary, Easy Balloon Mode is optional, and Hard Balloon Mode is neccesary only if you have Balloonsanity on.

It is important to note that it would be wise to have a completed file
If you do not have one I included one in the readme folder, r01.sav
You will have to put this file in the "SAVE" folder wherever you have the SonicR.exe downloaded
